                    <p>We are absolutely delighted with the work that Josephine has carried out on our house. What
                        started off as a small, room by room project, quickly grew to encompass our TV room, office,
                        master
                        bedroom, teenage daughter’s bedroom and guest room - in fact, most of the house! While each room
                        has it’s
                        own unique identity, there is a unifying consistency of theme throughout the house, which is
                        exactly
                        what we wanted. Josephine cleverly used many of our own things, up cycling as she went, and
                        married them with new and vintage pieces to create a stylish, yet practical, home. Her use of
                        wood,
                        metal, soft furnishings and stunning statement pieces in each room was simply inspired.
                        Josephine was a
                        pleasure to deal with throughout the project, which was delivered on time and on budget. We
                        wouldn’t hesitate to recommend her to others and indeed have already done so, with considerable
                        success.</p>

                    <p>From our first meeting I knew I'd found the perfect person to deliver the results I was looking
                        for. Josephine immediately understood what I was looking for and produced a design plan that was
                        perfect. Working with Josephine was a real pleasure! Highly recommended</p>

                  <br />
                    <p>"The brief was simple: I wanted a modern urban man cave with plywood and all that cool Shoreditch
                        style. Josephine first selected the main colour which is a deep blue, and some amazing William
                        Morris wallpaper. I was a bit sceptical about the latter but the end result is fabulous. She
                        organised some shelvings and storage with oiled OSB doors, suggested leaving the raw plywood
                        flooring and helped me selecting a nice Scandinavian desk. The end result is exactly ... me!"</p>

                    <p>I was in desperate need of advice on where to hang (or not hang) all the pictures I love, most of
                        which have sat in my attic collecting dust since we moved 6 years ago. Josephine’s amazing
                        designer’s intuition, coupled with a rationale behind all the decisions we made, was absolutely
                        fantastic. I felt that I was listened to and that we worked collaboratively resulting in my home
                        looking beautiful. It gives me such pleasure to look around my house now and would not hesitate
                        to use JLV Design again on my next interiors project. Thank you Josephine!</p>
